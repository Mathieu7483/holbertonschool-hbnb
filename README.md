# üìù Description Part 1
This project, HBnB Evolution, is the initial phase of developing a simplified AirBnB-like application. This part focuses on creating a comprehensive technical documentation blueprint using UML (Unified Modeling Language). The goal is to design the system's architecture and interactions before implementation, ensuring a clear and shared understanding among the team. The application is structured into three main layers: the Presentation Layer, the Business Logic Layer, and the Persistence Layer.

# üìÇ Exercise Content
This directory contains the UML diagrams and explanatory notes that form the technical documentation for the project.

[0. High-Level Package Diagram:](https://github.com/Mathieu7483/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/high%20package%20level%20diagram.md) A high-level package diagram illustrating the application's three-layer architecture and the communication between them via the Facade Pattern. This diagram provides an overview of the code's organization.

[1. Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer:](https://github.com/Mathieu7483/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/detailed%20classes%20diagram.md) A detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer. It models the core entities of the application (User, Place, Review, Amenity) with their attributes, methods, and relationships. This diagram is crucial for designing the data models.

[2. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls:](https://github.com/Mathieu7483/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/Sequence%20Diagrams%20for%20API%20Calls.md) A series of sequence diagrams that illustrate the flow of information and interactions between the different layers for specific use cases, such as user registration, place creation, review submission, and fetching a list of places.

[3. Documentation Compilation:](https://github.com/Mathieu7483/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/HBnB_Description_Notes.md) The compilation of all diagrams and their explanatory notes into a single, cohesive document. This final document serves as a complete reference for the implementation phase, ensuring the entire development team works from the same architectural vision.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Diagramming Software: Proficiency with a tool like Mermaid.js to create and manage UML diagrams.

UML Knowledge: A basic understanding of UML notation for class, package, and sequence diagrams is required.

# üöÄ Tests
As this project is a documentation and design exercise, there are no tests to run. The expected deliverables are the UML diagrams and the accompanying documentation.

# üìù Description Part 2
This second part of the HBnB project marks the beginning of the implementation phase of the application. After defining the architecture and design in the first stage, the objective here is to bring the software structure to life by developing the presentation layer (API) and the business logic layer using Python and the Flask framework, along with the flask-restx extension.
This project follows a modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability. The current setup implements the foundation for the Business Logic Layer (BLL), the API, and the in-memory persistence layer.

## üéØ Objectives and Tasks

### 1. Set Up the Project Structure
- Organize the project into a **modular architecture**, following Python and Flask best practices.
- Create packages for the **Presentation** and **Business Logic** layers.

### 2. Implement the Business Logic Layer
- Develop core classes for the business entities:
  `User`, `Place`, `Review`, and `Amenity`.
- Define **relationships** and **interactions** between entities.
- Apply the **Facade Design Pattern** to simplify communication between layers.

### 3. Build RESTful API Endpoints
- Implement **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities.
- Use **flask-restx** to define, document, and organize the API.
- Implement **data serialization** to include extended attributes (e.g., a `Place` should include the owner‚Äôs details and related amenities).

### 4. Test and Validate the API
- Test endpoints using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.
- Validate correct behavior and handle edge cases gracefully.

## üß† Project Vision and Scope
This implementation focuses on creating a **functional and scalable foundation** for the HBnB application.

### **Presentation Layer**
- Define services and endpoints using **Flask** and **flask-restx**.
- Ensure clear and logical API paths and parameters.

### **Business Logic Layer**
- Build the core models and logic driving the application.
- Handle **data validation**, **relationships**, and **entity interactions**.
